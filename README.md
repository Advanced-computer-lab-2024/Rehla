<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites and Installations 

First off, you need to make sure that you have visual studio code. Then you will need to install the zipped folder of the code from github.
Getting started with the MERN stack involves setting up the necessary software components and creating a basic project structure. Here's a brief summary of the steps to get started:

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):

Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version for your operating system.
The installation will also include npm, which is the package manager for Node.js.
Install MongoDB:

Visit the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions for your platform to set up MongoDB on your machine.

Create a new project directory:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location where you want to create your project.
Run the command mkdir mern-project to create a new directory for your MERN stack project.
Navigate into the project directory using cd mern-project.
Initialize a new Node.js project:

In the project directory, run the command npm init -y to create a new package.json file, which will manage your project dependencies.
Install the required dependencies:

Install Express.js, the web application framework, using the command npm install express.
Install Mongoose, the Object Document Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB, using the command npm install mongoose.
Install React, the front-end library, using the command npm install react.
Install additional dependencies as needed, such as react-dom, react-scripts, and cors.
Set up the project structure:

Create a new directory called server for your back-end code.
Create a new directory called client for your front-end code.
In the server directory, create an index.js file to set up the Express.js server.
In the client directory, create a new React app using create-react-app or a similar tool.
Connect the back-end and front-end:

In the server directory, configure the Express.js server to handle API requests and connect to the MongoDB database.
In the client directory, create React components and use the appropriate API calls to interact with the back-end.
Run the development environment:

Start the MongoDB server.
In the server directory, run node index.js to start the back-end server.
In the client directory, run npm start to start the front-end development server.
